This project is a lens-ray simulation developed for a hackathon with a focus on creating physics-oriented software. Utilizing Python and the Turtle graphics library, the program simulates the behavior of light rays interacting with lenses, as taught in physics classes.

## Features
- **Ray Angle and Position Input**: Users can input the angle and position of the incident ray.
- **Physics-Based Simulation**: The program accurately simulates the reflection and refraction of light rays based on physical principles.
- **Turtle Graphics**: Utilizes Turtle, a native Python library, for drawing the simulation in a GUI environment.

## Installation
To run this simulation, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, clone this repository or download the source code. No additional libraries are required as Turtle is part of the standard Python library.

## Usage
To start the simulation, run the main Python script:

```bash
python lens_ray_sim.py
```
and thats it
